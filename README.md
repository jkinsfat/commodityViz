# commodityViz

I chose to render the exported goods for each of the United States in the year 2012 in a Scatter plot for multiple reasons. The first, is that a single data point has a quantitative variable and two nominal variables. These nominal variables have large sets of values: their cardinalities are 44 and 50. The quantitative values map to the members of the cartesian product of these two sets, whose cardinality is 2,200. The best way to show both the quantitative value and which nominal values they are connected too was using a heatmap matrix, where the two dimensions encode the two nominal variables and the saturation of the cell at their intersection encodes the quantitative values. Although the quantitatve value would be etter understood if it was encoded in cell size, 2,200 shapes of differing sizes would be much more difficult for the user to comprehend since the majority of them would not fit on the screen. This rendering allows the user to compare the trends across all of the nominal values, wheras encoding the three variables in another visualization, say a 3d scatterplot, would require the nominal sets to be much smaller (ot to mention that one of the nominal sets would need to be quantitative so that the chart doesn't fake a dimension in the data).
